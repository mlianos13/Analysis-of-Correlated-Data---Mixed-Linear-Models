# Analysis-of-Correlated-Data---Mixed-Linear-Models
This study is dedicated to examining the influence of different diets and the progression of time on the protein percentage in cow milk.

Summary

For the requirements of Assignment 5 in the Analysis of Correlated Data: Mixed Linear
Models class, a detailed statistical analysis was conducted. The primary objective of this
study was to investigate the impact of different diets and the progression of time on the
protein percentage in cow milk. The study aimed to discern how varying diets influence
milk protein content over a period and to quantify these effects using appropriate statistical
models.
The analytical approach of this study was divided into three distinct phases:
Model Diagnostics and Selection: The initial phase focused on examining various mixedeffects models to accurately represent the data.
Statistical Analysis: The central part of the analysis involved applying the chosen mixedeffects model to understand the fixed effects of diet and time on milk protein percentage.
This phase included evaluating the significance of these effects, conducting post-hoc pairwise comparisons, and estimating marginal means to interpret the fixed effects in a practical
context.
Interpretation and Conclusions: The final phase synthesized the analytical findings into
meaningful insights.

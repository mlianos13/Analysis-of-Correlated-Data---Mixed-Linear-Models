# Analysis-of-Correlated-Data---Mixed-Linear-Models
This study is dedicated to examining the influence of different diets and the progression of time on the protein percentage in cow milk.

Summary

For the requirements of the final Assignment in the Analysis of Correlated Data: Mixed Linear
Models class in my MSc degree on Mathematical Modelling and Computation, a detailed statistical
analysis was conducted. The primary objective of thisstudy was to investigate the impact of different
diets and the progression of time on theprotein percentage in cow milk. The study aimed to discern how 
varying diets influencemilk protein content over a period and to quantify these effects using appropriate 
statistical models.

The analytical approach of this study was divided into three distinct phases:

Model Diagnostics and Selection: The initial phase focused on examining various mixed-effects models 
to accurately represent the data.

Statistical Analysis: The central part of the analysis involved applying the chosen mixed-effects model 
to understand the fixed effects of diet and time on milk protein percentage. This phase included evaluating 
the significance of these effects, conducting post-hoc pair-wise comparisons, and estimating marginal means 
to interpret the fixed effects in a practical context.

Interpretation and Conclusions: The final phase synthesized the analytical findings into meaningful insights.
